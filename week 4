Question 1
For each character in the string saved in ael, append that character to a list that should be saved in a variable app.

ael = "python!"
app = []
for char in ael:
    app.append(char)

Question 2
For each string in wrds, add ‘ed’ to the end of the word (to make the word past tense). Save these past tense words to a list called past_wrds.

past_wrds = []
for char in wrds:
    past_wrds.append(char+'ed')
